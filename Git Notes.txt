Git notes:
git init //to add git to a project

git status //to check if there is anything to commit; any changes have been made to the file
git log //to see all commits made and changes 

git add filename.html //to put in staging mode
git add . //to put everything with changes to stagging mode
git commit -m "comment on commit" //to a commit changes

A branch is for trying new things on top of the master without affecting the master

git branch //check which branch is on right now
git branch nameofbranch //to create a new branch

git checkout hashcode448dbd7d55c6bc66238506 //to go to a previous commit; you cna get the hashcode of commits from log
git checkout nameofbranch //changing to branch

git merge nameofbranch //merge branch to master

git remote -v //check if its connected to an online repo
git remote add origin https://linktorepo //add a remote;online repo (with link) as origin (origin is what you name it can change this)
git push -u origin master //push a branch to the origin; means the same thing as uploading the files to the orgin
git pull orgin master //pull the changed /modified branch from the orgin; means the same thing as downloading changes to files from origin

Fork on Github allows to make your own version of other reposotories so you chnage stuff without
It gives you your own version of the repo and gives you a link to clone

git clone https://github/rokon07/nameofrepo //get this link from the fork button; this will download the files of the repo to local machine
then you can commit changes and if you click on the commits on github you can request a pull request

pull request //means you are asking the github repo to accept your changes which you committed on your fork version of the repo
similarly if you host a public repo and get push request from others you can merge to master
